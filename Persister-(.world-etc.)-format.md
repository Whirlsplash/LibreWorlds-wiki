Data in Persister format does not mark itself to indicate their types, the types are assumed by the deserialization code. That is, a Portal being read in knows when to expect a boolean, a string, and an integer, for example. Without knowing what a Portal wants to read, it is not possible to determine where the next item begins.

During reading or writing, WorldsPlayer maintains 3 tables: Object table, Class table, Cookie table (for versions). These serve as a caching mechanism, so that objects can be reused and class names do not need to be repeated.

# Primitive data types

Worlds generally uses the format described by [Java's DataInput](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/io/DataInput.html).

* String: Starts with a byte, where 0x01 means the string is null (and the next byte is for the next item) and 0x00 means non-null. If non-null, next 2 bytes are the length in number of bytes (big-endian). Following is the actual string data, in modified UTF-8. (The bytes after the non-null indicator are merely read by DataInput).
* Boolean: 1 byte, 0x00 for false 0x01 for true.
* Byte, Double, Long, Int, Float, Short: Self-explanatory
* Arrays, vectors, maybenulls: Explained below 

# Header and footer

* Persister files begin with the String "PERSISTER Worlds, Inc." (remember the 3 bytes at beginning), followed by an integer representing persister format version (7 seems to be latest), followed by an object.

* Persister files end with the String "END PERSISTER"

# Objects

Assuming empty class and object table, an object consists of an object ID (integer), a class ID (integer), class name (String), and then data as determined by the specific class.

## Example from GroundZero

|"PERSISTER Worlds, Inc." | Persister version | Object ID | Class ID | Class name |
|-------------------------|-------------------|-----------|----------|----------|------------|
| 0x00 0x00 0x16 "PERSISTER Worlds, Inc." | 0x00 0x00 0x00 0x07 | 0x00 0x00 0x03 0x67 | 0x00 0x00 0x02 0xE6 | 0x00 0x00 0x16 "NET.worlds.scape.World" |
