Sharing occurs with "Attributes" attached to a [[NET.worlds.scape.Sharer]] on an object. Such an attachment causes a ForwardAttribute to be attached to the Room (technically the nearest container with even Sharing Mode). Forwarder attrID
 on the Attribute corresponds to Attribute ID of the associated ForwardAttribute. The user of Attribute ID on the original Attribute is currently unknown.

Sharing works via [[PROPSET]]/[[PROPUPD]] directed (usually) to the room. ObjID #253 in the client's PROPSET corresponds to the current room. The property ID used is the one for the "Forwarder attrID"/ForwardAttribute's Attribute ID.
